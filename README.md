# Project 3 Crypto Blog

## Wireframes

* See assets/ in repo 

## Team Guidelines

* Fix your errors before pushing up 
* Divide the features out among us evenly, trying to work to one another's strengths
* Test code while building, and understand why it works
* Double check syntax/spelling always
* Communication is key!
* When you're committing to git, announce it to the whole team
* Keep naming conventions consistent, record in repo's Wiki
* Never push broken code to master
* Review pull request as group
* Try to pair-program through the major features of the app
* Never work in the master unless debuggin with the team
* Debug using testing branch, and delete when completed
* Take notes when we hold "team meetings", record progress as we go
* Be on time for agreed-upon meetings

========================================

## Brainstorm/Initial Thoughts

* A public blog/social hub that displays blog posts created by users
* Homepage contains a ticker of most current spot prices of most popular coins
* Include a nav bar with a Home, About, and Resources tab
    * Home tab brings you back to home route, which displays all the blog posts
    * Resource center for news outlets, exchanges, and literature
        * Include links to articles, podcasts, books, etc.
* Serve as a place to check what is current/trending in the crypto world
* Use API() to get pricing data, which we have tested in Postman

## Why Build This?
    
* Cryptocurrecies have become the hottest trend around, as vast fortunes are being made almost overnight by people young and old who have gotten in early to this modern-day gold rush. While someone has undoubtedly mentioned bitcoin or blockchain technoology to you, these subjects are not so easily understood. The information about these technologies is scattered, inconsistent, and complicated. As cryptocurrency enthusiasts with both personal and professional experience in this world, we seek to crack the code on this issue with our Crypto Blog.

## Initial Challenges

* Git branching - there's no getting around this challenge. Issues are sure to arise and will be our biggest threat to meeting deadlines.

* Working remotely - while we plan to meet up for full working days over the break, there will be times when we work remotely. Communication will be key as it relates to delegation of tasks and git branches merging up properly.

* React Router - if we decide to use React Router, this could be challenging to build and debug as we have virtually no hands-on experience as of now.

* CRUD - our react/express CRUD homework was a challenge - implementing this correctly on the backend and having it work on the React front-end is likely the most important feature of the project.
