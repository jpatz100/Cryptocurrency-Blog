    'Blockchain 101',
    'By now, I’m sure most of you have heard about the “blockchain”; the technology powering the unprecedented price rises of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. But do you actually know what it is? Over the holidays, I found myself frequently having to explain the fundamentals of the blockchain and its potential future importance with family members, guests, and co-workers as discussions swirled around the crypto-craze that has swept the world during the past few months. Admittedly, I might have gone overboard with technical details in a few areas...so enter this blog. My goal is demystify how the blockchain works from a very high level so anyone can understand the potential of this powerful new technology. In future posts, I’ll go into more technical explanations of different blockchain fundamentals and topics, but for today I’m going to keep it simple; explaining the basics of what the blockchain actually is.

    'A Beginner’s Guide to Blockchain',
    'I don’t get why people find it difficult to understand Blockchain. I wonder why I myself didn’t. It was in 2013 I first heard about Bitcoin (yea, too late). I was poor to purchase one, so tried mining it. If I had been successful, you wouldn’t be reading this. Later, I thought of studying its underlying technology, the Blockchain. But, I was too busy with my startup (that didn’t work out either). See full post (https://hackernoon.com/a-beginners-guide-to-blockchain-d04266844e7).',

    'By any measure, 2017 was an epic year for Crypto, which I define as the confluence of the blockchain, cryptocurrency, decentralization, smart contracts and zero-knowledge proof.

    '10 keys for evaluating Initial Coin Offering (ICO) investments',
    'An initial coin offering (ICO) is a fundraising method that trades future crypto coins for cryptocurrencies which have an immediate, liquid value. Usually, a percentage of the tokens is sold to ICO participants and a percentage kept for the company’s needs (private investors, etc. Terms differ from one ICO to another). An ICO allows both big and small investors to fund the projects they like. The recent year carried thousands of successful ICO stories. The motivation for the project is obvious. The motivation for the investors of the ICO is that the price of the token would be higher (or much higher) than the token’s price during the ICO.
